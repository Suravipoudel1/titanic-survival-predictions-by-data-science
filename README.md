# Titanic-survival-predictions-by-data-science
A Streamlit web app that predicts Titanic passenger survival using a logistic regression model. Users input details like age, gender, and class to get real-time predictions. Model trained on the Titanic dataset.

# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. By analyzing passenger data such as age, gender, class, and other factors, the model determines the likelihood of survival.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle’s Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and contains information about the passengers, including:  
- PassengerId  
- Pclass (Ticket class)  
- Name  
- Sex  
- Age  
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)  
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)  
- Ticket  
- Fare  
- Cabin  
- Embarked (Port of Embarkation)  

## Project Overview
The project follows a structured machine learning workflow:  
1. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values and inconsistent entries.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding relationships and distributions in the data.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Transforming and encoding features for modeling.  
4. **Model Building** – Using various machine learning algorithms to predict survival.  
5. **Evaluation** – Assessing model performance using accuracy and other metrics.  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Results

The model predicts the survival of Titanic passengers with high accuracy, demonstrating the importance of factors such as age, gender, and passenger class in survival rates.
